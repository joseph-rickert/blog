> The below article refers to setting up R and RStudio Server on a cloud Linux instance in a way that ensures R project reproducibility and facilitates collaboration.  Many possible workflows exist to accomplish this.  One might call the below presentation an "opinionated" solution based on what we have found to work in a production environment.  Importantly, all development is on an RStudio Server cloud Linux instance, ensuring that we only have to support one operating system.

## Using a fixed version of R on linux to facilitate reproducibility and collaboration

We will keep the motivation for [good versioning](https://semver.org/) and [reproducibility](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html) short:  R projects evolve over time, as do the packages that they rely on.  R projects that do not control package versions will eventually break and/or not be shareable or [reproducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis)[^1].

Since R is a slowly evolving language, it might be reasonable to require that a particular Linux instance have only one version of R installed.  However, requiring all R users to use the same versions of all packages to facilitate collaboration is clearly out of the question.  The solution is to control package versions at the project level.

## Packrat manages package dependencies

We use [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) to control package versions.  It is already integrated with RStudio Server.  Packrat ensures that all installed packages are stored *with* the project[^2].  Packrat also ensures that these packages are available when a project is opened.  With Packrat, we know that project A will always be able to use ggplot2 2.5.0 and project B will always be able to use ggplot2 3.1.0.  This is important if we want to be able to reproduce results in the future.

## Packrat package paths

On Linux, Packrat stores compiled packages in `packrat/lib/<LINUX_FLAVOR>/<R_VERSION>`, an R-version-specific path, relative to the project's base directory.  An issue arises if we are using R version 3.5.0 one week and then upgrade to R 3.5.1 the next week: a Packrat project will not find the 3.5.0 libraries anymore, and we will need to rebuild all the packages to install them in the 3.5.1 path.  Packrat will automatically build all packages from source (sources are stored in `packrat/src`) if it notices they are missing, however this process can take tens of minutes, depending on the number of packages being built.  Since this can be cumbersome when collaborating, we also opt to include the `packrat/lib` path in version control, thereby committing the compiled libraries as well.

In summary, our solution is to bind one fixed R version to an instance[^5] and release fixed-R instance images periodically.  What we lose by not being on the bleeding edge of (thankfully relatively non-critical) bugfixes we gain in ease of collaboration.  Here's what we've done to accomplish this:

* [rstudio-instance](https://github.com/ras44/rstudio-instance) contains branches with scripts to set up a Linux instance with fixed R and RStudio versions.  We `git clone` the repo and `git checkout` the branch suitable for the Linux flavor, R-version, and RStudio version we want.  The scripts also ensure R is not auto-updated in the future.
* We then run the install script to set up the instance and archive an image of it for future use.
* Once the fixed-R instance is set up, [rstudio-project](https://github.com/ras44/rstudio-project) contains an R-version specific base project with pre-built, Packrat-managed, fixed-versions of many popular data-science packages[^3].
* We `git clone` [rstudio-project](https://github.com/ras44/rstudio-project) to a new project directory locally and remove the existing `.git` directory so that it can be turned it into a new git repo with `git init`.
* We open the project in RStudio and begin work.  All packages are pre-built, so we don't have to go through lengthy installs.  We can upgrade packages in the `Packrat Library` of the "Packages" tab, and then run `packrat::snapshot()` to save any libraries and ugrades into the project's `packrat/` directory.  We can then `git add packrat` to add any Packrat updates to the project's git repo.
* If we ever need to duplicate results, we can always build the same fixed-R instance (or clone the image we stored earlier), clone the project on the instance, and know that it will work exactly the same as when we previously worked on it... sometimes years earlier.

Here is a quick example script showing the workflow:
```
git clone git@github.com:ras44/rstudio-instance.git
cd rstudio-instance
git checkout centos7_R3.5.0_RSS1.1.453
./install.sh
sudo passwd <USERNAME> # set user password for RStudio Server login
cd
git clone git@github.com:ras44/rstudio-project.git new-project
cd new-project
git checkout dev-linux-centos7-R3.5.0
rm -rf .git
git init
```

## Why we use a fixed version of R
* We want to ensure reproducibility and make collaboration easier.
* We aren't able to or don't want to use docker containers[^4].
* We prefer limited, consistent R-versions over continually upgrading to the "latest" version of R.


## Issues we have run into with Packrat
Please note, this is not an exhaustive list of issues, nor are these issues likely to arise in every use case.  RStudio support has been very helpful in addressing many issues, and may be able to provide input on these too.

![Packrat libraries are listed under "Project Library"](/post/2019-01-05-using-a-fixed-version-of-r-on-linux_files/packrat-project-libs.PNG){width=500px}

* Occasionally memory-management issues will arise, causing R to crash.  We are not sure if this is due to Packrat.  However if a crash does occur, the project **must be re-opened** in order for the Packrat libraries to be loaded again.  Attempting to use the project immediately after a crash-restart will not load the Packrat libraries.  Whether or not packages are loaded can be verified by looking at the "packages" tab in RStudio Server and ensuring a "Project Library" header exists with associated Packrat versions included in a Packrat column (see above image).

* We have found [some issues](https://github.com/r-dbi/bigrquery/issues/247) appear to arise only when using to Packrat.  The suggestion is that it is likely a package incompatibility problem due to the packages installed not having been updated.  This can be challenging to troubleshoot and raises the question of what to do when package versions become incompatible with each other.

* Packrat appears to have limited support for installing packages from private/corporate internal githubs, though this might have evolved since we last attempted such an install.  An easy solution exists: we simply clone the package to a local directory such as `~/local_repos/` (used for install of the package only).  Then we use Packrat's `install_local()` feature to install from the `local_repos` directory.  Once it is installed, it is in the Packrat path, and the original source in '~/local_repos/` can be discarded.

## Benefits of using a fixed version of R
While binding a fixed version of R to an instance may seem restrictive, we have found that it is in fact quite liberating.  Since we only update the existing R version infrequently (think once a year), the barrier of agreeing on an R-version is removed and with it any need to agree on package versions at the user level.  Instead, packages are distributed with the project via git.  The benefits of fixing the R version for a particular instance are:

* Sharing Packrat projects and reproducing results are both made easier, since pre-compiled libraries are included with the projects
* Fixing the R-version on an instance doesn't keep us from upgrading R for a project, as packrat will automatically build and install libraries if an upgraded version is detected.  In this way, a project can be opened on an instance with an upgraded R version and have its libraries compiled.  Our limited instance image release schedule means the overhead to handle this only occurs at a maximum of once each year.
* It is very unlikely that results will be different across R-versions, however being able to tie project results to one R-version allows us to upgrade R for a project while ensuring that results remain as expected.



[^1]: Unless you somehow exclusively use packages that are never updated, never implement version-breaking/major version updates, or always provide backwards-compatible version upgrades.  Many R packages are in major version 0, meaning there is no guarantee that a future release will maintain the same API.

[^4]: docker containers may be a good alternate solution, but in this case we are not using them
[^5]: It [is possible](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/215488098-Installing-multiple-versions-of-R-on-Linux) to have multiple R versions installed on a system, however I've avoided that for simplicity
